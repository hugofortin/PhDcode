Code used for the paper
Currently requires improvement to speed.
Higher dimensionality cases might be doable using parallel computing or at least a distributed system to compute the ranks, as the experiment shows using the 81 by 81 case.

!!!VERY IMPORTANT!!!
The automatic parts only work for cases that respect the convention for complex conjugation in the paper, otherwise requires tweaking or manual input.
